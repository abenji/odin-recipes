        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This Cheesy Rotisserie Chicken Enchilada Skillet dinner is about as fast as enchiladas can get, and that’s because it’s not really enchiladas—it’s a tortilla casserole made all in one cooking vessel.</p>
            
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>½ onion (chopped)</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 16-ounce jar enchilada sauce (I used my own, homemade)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sour cream (plus more for serving)</li>
                <li>4 corn tortillas (torn into quarters)</li>
                <li>4 cups shredded chicken ((from a 2½-pound rotisserie chicken, skin and bones removed))</li>
                <li>1 15-ounce can low sodium black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
                <li>3 ounces shredded cheese (such as a Mexican cheese blend, Monterey Jack, or mozzarella (about 3/4 cup))</li>
                <li>jalapeño peppers and chopped fresh cilantro (for serving (optional))</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a 10-inch oven-safe (preferably cast- iron) skillet over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the onion, garlic, cumin, and salt and cook, stirring, until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the onion mixture to a large bowl; set aside the hot skillet.</li>
                <li>Add the enchilada sauce, sour cream, and 1/4 cup water to the onion mixture and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Fold in the tortillas, chicken, and beans until thoroughly coated.</li>
                <li>Spoon the mixture into the reserved skillet and cook over medium heat until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese all over the top and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let cool slightly, then top the enchiladas with sour cream, jalapeños, and cilantro (if desired) and serve directly from the skillet at the table.</li>
            </ol>
